Course Overview
---------------

This course provides a critical analysis of mass media in our culture. Various types of media such as books, films, video games, and online interactions will be discussed and reviewed. This course will also evaluate how information and ideas travel between people on a large scale.

This course critically analyzes media communication, articles, and media experiences. While there is no required textbook for this class, students are expected to write and continually revise their writing. Good writers benefit from having conversations about their work-in-progress, understanding that they will change their minds many times in the course of writing. Students are discouraged from writing papers the day before they're due because, as a writing strategy, it precludes the pleasure of hard won discovery that arises from thinking about how to articulate ideas for yourself and for others.
